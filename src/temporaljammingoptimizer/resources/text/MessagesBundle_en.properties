# about content
aboutText = <html><body align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Temporal Jamming Optimizer was developed for a study about wireless security presented by Peter Lehotay-Kery and Daniel Mernyei, students of Eotvos Lorand University.</p><p>The challenge is to assign an activity probability value for each jammer placed around a storage to isolate wireless communication inside the storage from possible eavesdroppers. The overall activity probability has to be high enough to prevent eavesdroppers from receiving understandable information, and at the same time has to be low enough to not to disturb the wireless communication inside the storage. It also has to be as low as possible in order to save energy. This tool demonstrates 2 algorithms which solve this problem. The first uses the Nearest Jammer model, while the second uses the 2-Nearest Jammer model.</p><p>This project was based on the scientific article "Secure Communication through Jammers Jointly Optimized in Geography and Time", written by Yair Allouche, Yuval Cassuto, Alon Efrat, Michael Segal, Esther Arkin, Guy Grebla, Joseph S. B. Mitchell and Swaminathan Sankararaman, published in 2015.</p></font></body></html>

# exception messages
defaultIncorrectMapExceptionMessage = An unexpected error occurred during loading the map.
incorrectDimensionType = The coordinates of each point have to be integers in both dimensions.\nA point does not satisfy this requirement in the requested map at line
incorrectDimensionCount = The coordinates of each point have to consist of 2 dimensions.\nA point does not satisfy this requirement in the requested map at line
pointOutOfMap = Each point has to be inside the bounds of the map.\nA point does not satisfy this requirement in the requested map at line
controlledRegionIsConcaveOrHasNoArea = The controlled region in the requested map is either concave or has no area.
storageIsConcaveOrHasNoArea = The storage in the requested map is either concave or has no area.
storageNotInsideControlledRegion = At least 1 vertex of the storage is outside of the controlled region in the requested map.\nThe storage has to be completely inside the controlled region.
jammerNotInsideControlledRegion = At least 1 jammer is outside of the controlled region in the requested map.\nAll jammers have to be in the controlled region.
jammerInsideStorage = At least 1 jammer is inside the storage in the requested map.\nJammers are not allowed in the storage.
incorrectMapStructure = The structure of the map is incorrect.\nThe map has to contain 4 series (separated by empty lines) of 2D coordinates (dimensions are separated by spaces).\nEach line can contain at most one 2D coordinate.\nThe 4 series of 2D coordinates represent the following objects respectively:\nFence points, Storage points, Jammer positions, Witness points.
twoNearestJammersAreNotAdjacent = The requested map is based on the 2-Nearest Jammer model,\n but there is at least 1 witness point to which the 2 nearest jammers are not adjacent.
jammerTooFarFromStorageOrEavesdropperPoints = There is at least 1 jammer in the requested map which does not have at least 1 storage and eavesdropper point nearby.
