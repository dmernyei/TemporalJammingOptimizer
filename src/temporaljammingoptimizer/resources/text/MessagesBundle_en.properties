# about content
aboutText = <html><body align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="4"><p>Temporal Jamming Optimizer was developed for a study about wireless security presented by Peter Lehotay-Kery and Daniel Mernyei, students of Eotvos Lorand University.</p><p>The challenge is to assign an activity probability value for each jammer placed around a storage to isolate wireless communication inside the storage from possible eavesdroppers. The overall activity probability has to be high enough to prevent eavesdroppers from receiving understandable information, and at the same time has to be low enough to not to disturb the wireless communication inside the storage. It also has to be as low as possible in order to save energy. This tool demonstrates 2 algorithms which solve this problem. The first uses the Nearest Jammer model, while the second uses the 2-Nearest Jammer model.</p><p>This project was based on the scientific article "Secure Communication through Jammers Jointly Optimized in Geography and Time", written by Yair Allouche, Yuval Cassuto, Alon Efrat, Michael Segal, Esther Arkin, Guy Grebla, Joseph S. B. Mitchell and Swaminathan Sankararaman, published in 2015.</p></font></body></html>
